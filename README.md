# python-notebooks

## List of Python notebooks to upload

### A notebook focussed on testing the outputs of a Random Number Generator: comes with an *.ipynb and a *.csv which is read into the file at the top. 

### A python notebook which analyses an experiment statistically and outputs a load of data: comes with one *.ipynb and two *.csvs which are read in at the top.

### A Big data python notebook which imports a compiled .py file in the same file/tree and then runs the functions from that file (I can’t remember what it does, it’s from a Data Science course I did at general assembly)
